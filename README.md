# Iris Flower Classification

ðŸŒ¸ Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification repository! ðŸŒ¼

This repository contains the code for a predictive model implemented in Jupyter Notebook. The model is trained to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Iris Flower Classification dataset sourced from Kaggle.

## Task

The goal is to train a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species.

## Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The code for the predictive model, along with beautiful insights and visualizations.

## Features

- In-depth analysis and insights into the Iris Flower Classification dataset.
- Visualizations to help understand the characteristics and relationships between different species.

## Hope you enjoy exploring the notebook! ðŸŒº
